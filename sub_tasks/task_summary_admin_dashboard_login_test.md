# admin_dashboard_login_test

The login functionality of the admin dashboard at https://b0jjcpg0jwqn.space.minimax.io was tested. The login with demo credentials was successful, and the main dashboard loaded correctly. However, a critical JavaScript error on the 'Station Management' page caused it to crash, preventing further testing. The error message is 'Error: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string.'. The authentication fix seems to be working, but the new issue on the Station Management page needs to be addressed.
