# Website Test Report: Station Management Module

**URL:** https://zrbm04i1opj0.space.minimax.io

## 1. Objective
To conduct a comprehensive test of the Station Management module, covering all CRUD operations and administrative features as per the user's request.

## 2. Testing Summary
The testing process was halted at the login stage due to a critical application error. I was unable to access the Station Management module and therefore could not perform any of the requested tests.

### Steps Taken:
1.  **Navigation:** Successfully navigated to the provided URL, which presented a login page for the "EcolithSwap Admin Dashboard".
2.  **Account Creation Attempt:** An attempt to use `create_test_account` failed as the tool was not configured for this website.
3.  **Login Attempt:** I identified demo credentials (`admin@ecolithswap.com` / `password123`) displayed on the login page and attempted to log in. The login attempts were unsuccessful, and the page reloaded without granting access.
4.  **Troubleshooting:** I made multiple attempts to log in and even tried to navigate directly to the dashboard URL, but was consistently redirected back to the login page.

## 3. Key Findings & Issues
The root cause of the login failure was identified by inspecting the browser's console logs.

**Critical Issue: Authentication Failure due to Misconfiguration**

*   **Error:** The application is unable to communicate with the authentication server. The console logs show a `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` error.
*   **Cause:** The application is configured to send authentication requests to a placeholder URL: `https://placeholder.supabase.co/auth/v1/token`. This URL is not a valid, resolvable domain name.
*   **Impact:** This is a **blocking issue**. No user can log in to the application, rendering all functionality behind the login wall inaccessible.

### Console Error Log Evidence:
```
Error #4:
  type: supabase.api.error
  timestamp: 2025-08-02T15:05:55.454Z
  request: {'url': 'https://placeholder.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password', ...}
  response: {'headers': {}, 'duration': 14}
  success: False
  error: {'message': 'net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED', 'name': 'NetworkError'}
```

## 4. Conclusion & Recommendation
The Station Management module could not be tested due to a critical login error. The application is not ready for production use, or even for further testing, until this authentication issue is resolved.

**Recommendation:**
The development team must correct the Supabase configuration in the application's environment to point to the correct, valid Supabase project URL. Once this is fixed, the login functionality should be re-tested, and only then can the full testing of the Station Management module proceed.
